# Full Stack Development Journey ðŸš€

This repository is my personal log of learning and building as I dive deep into full stack development. Here, I document my process, experiments, and milestones as I combine modern technologies to create robust, real-world web applications.

**Whatâ€™s Inside**

- **Frontend:** Starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build foundations, then exploring React.js, modern UI/UX, and responsive layouts
- **Backend:** Building APIs with Node.js and Express, tackling authentication and security
- **Database:** Integrating PostgreSQL/MongoDB, designing schemas, and optimizing queries
- **DevOps:** Experimenting with Docker, CI/CD, and cloud deployment workflows
- **Extra:** Debugging tricky problems, trying out new tools, and continuously learning best practices

Iâ€™ll be updating this repo with progress notes, architecture decisions, wins, setbacks, and key insights as I evolve from concept to deployment.

**Follow along if youâ€™re interested in the hands-on journey of a developer building from scratch!**
